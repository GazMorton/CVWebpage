        <h2> Profile </h2>
        <hr>
                <p>Aspiring Software Developer with 4 months of software development experience using Python, Django, and agile development. Seeking opportunities to apply strong programming/coding skills whilst drawing on vast experience as a technically gifted SQL database and QlikView data analyst in the financial audit and telecommunications sectors.</p>
                <p>I have been working in data analytics since I graduated with a 1st class Accounting and Finance degree in 2017. I secured a job in this sector as a Data Analytics Assistant and moved my way up to Senior Assistant and then TRA Data Analyst. These were technical roles that sparked a keen interest in programming languages and software solutions. At BDO, I wrote back-end code for loading big data into QlikView dashboards, performed software testing of new features, and used SQL to provide evidence-based analytics reports. I volunteered to do development work on a sales analysis dashboard with the software developers at the firm, which provided me with insight into the work they performed day-to-day. Since that time, I have been highly motivated in moving towards a career in Computer Science. </p>
                <p>My passions are music, technology and sports. My dream job would be to work in the software developer teams for a music streaming service or a company that develops Digital Audio Workstations.</p>
